# Frequensee
A command line interface (`cli`) tool used to create animations based on audio frequencies by utilizing the `Fast Fourier Transform (fft)` of the audio data. `Frequensee` uses `FFMPEG` to create the animations, so it either needs to be installed or have the `ffmpeg.exe` executable be present in the working directory.
