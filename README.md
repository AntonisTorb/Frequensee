# Frequensee

A command line interface (`cli`) tool used to create animations based on audio frequencies by utilizing the `Fast Fourier Transform (fft)` of the audio data. `Frequensee` uses `FFMPEG` to create the animations, so it either needs to be installed or have the `ffmpeg.exe` executable be present in the working directory.

## Installation

`Frequensee` is released as a package on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/frequensee/), so you can install it with pip using the following command:

```
pip install frequensee
```

or by downloading the source code from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/AntonisTorb/Frequensee).

## Dependencies

`Frequensee` has 3 major dependencies:

- [Soundfile](https://pypi.org/project/soundfile/): Used to read the data of the audio file and return them as a `numpy` array.
- [Matplotlib](https://pypi.org/project/matplotlib/): Used to create the frames of the animation basd on the data above.
- [FFMPEG](https://www.ffmpeg.org/): Used to combine the frames and produce the animation file.

The first two are installed automatically when installing `frequensee` through `PyPI`. You can also install them with pip using the `requirements.txt` file provided.

As for `FFMPEG`, you can either compile the source code yourself, or use an already compiled version. Personally, I use the executable provided by [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/FFmpeg-Builds/releases/tag/latest). The installation process is not too straight forward, but there are several available tutorials online. In any case, you can also have the `FFMPEG` executable file in the current working directory and it should work the same.

## How to use

### Cli version

If you installed through `PyPI`, the easiest way to run `frequensee` is with either of the following commands:
```
fqc -i "input file path" -o "output file path"
frequensee -i "input file path" -o "output file path"
```
Examples:
```
fqc -i "input.wav" -o "videos/output.gif"
frequensee -i "audio/input.mp3" -o "output.mp4"
```

If you installed from source, you can run the `main.py` file instead (remember to install the dependancies in `requirements.txt` first):
```
python main.py -i "input file path" -o "output file path"
```
or copy the code inside the `main.py` file to your desired python file.

Additional command line options can be found in the [command line options](#command-line-options) section.

### Importing from source

Instead of running the `cli` version, it is possible to import and create all the components of `frequensee` and customize them from the source code. For example:

```
from frequensee.config import Config
from frequensee.audio_viz import AudioVisualizer

config = Config()
viz = AudioVisualizer(config)
viz.load("path to audio file)
viz.create_bar_animation("path to output file")

viz.load("path to other audio file)
config2 = Config(different options)
viz.load_config(config2)

viz.create_fft_animation("path to output file")
viz.extract_json("path to output file")
```

The `Config` class contains values required for the `AudioVisualizer` instance to create the animations/export the data. Please refer to the class documentation if you wish to configure the default values.

The `load` method will read the audio data from the audio file in the provided filepath.

The `load_config` method can be used to update the configuration of the `AudioVisualizer` instance after it has been initialized.

There are 2 main `AudioVisualizer` methods used to produce the animations:

- `create_bar_animation`: Creates an animation of bar shaped gradient images based on the relative amplitude. The frequency range is not visible in the resulting animation and the result is purely aesthetic.

- `create_fft_animation`: Creates an animation of the relative amplitude over frequency, over time, as it was created from the Fast Fourier Transform (fft) of the input audio data. 

Additionally, there is the option to export the bar amplitude data in `json` format, if you prefer to use a different visualization methods or tool, by using the `extract_json` method. The structure is as follows:
```
{
    "audio_filepath": "path to input audio file (str)",
    "bars": "amount of bars created for the visuals (int)",
    "bar_graph": [
        [array of relative bar amplitudes for first frame (floats)],
        ...
        [array of relative bar amplitudes for last frame (floats)]
    ]
}
```

The `bar_graph` array's length is equal to the number of frames generated, while each frame array's length is equal to the number of bars.

### Output

The only output formats that have been tested and are natively supported for `frequensee` are: `mp4`, `gif` and `webp`.

While it has not been tested, all formats compatible with your version of `FFMPEG` should be compatible with `frequensee`, provided.

You can check the formats and codecs supported in your version of `FFMPEG` by running the command:

```
ffmpeg -formats
ffmpeg -codecs
```

Formats other than the natively supported ones might require additional ffmpeg options that can be passed by using the [`-f`command line option](#command-line-options) to the `cli` version.

Unfortunately, the order of `FFMPEG` parameters matters, so it might be difficult to use the `cli` version of `frequensee` for some formats. In such cases, please look into the `writers.py` module, which contains a custom `FFMpegWriter` class. It's possible to add options in the `_args` method in the correct place in the command.

## Common output formats: Advantages and Disadvantages
- `mp4`: The creation of mp4 files is the default configuration for video formats. The advantages include low memory usage, embedded audio, and great compatibilty. 

    On the other hand, the biggest disadvantage is the lack of background transparency. Of course, with a proper choice of background color, it will be possible to introduce transparency with video editing software.

- `gif`: The biggest advantage of gifs is the option to have a transparent background on the resulting animation without having to use additional editing software.

    This comes with many disadvantages however. Memory usage for gif creation with `FFMPEG` rises rapidly and can easily fill up your system's available memory. Additionally, the maximum framerate is limited to `30fps`, cannot include the source audio, and the resulting filesize can be orders of magnitude larger than an mp4 file.

- `webp`: A format similar to `gif`, with the added advantages of smaller file size and low memory usage during creation. Unfortunately, it has many compatibility issues even in modern systems and is mostly useful in web development.

Currently, only `gif` and `webp` are supported for image formats.

For the above reasons, it is recommended to use `mp4` or `webp` as the output format if possible. If a `gif` is needed, please make sure to limit the amount of frames included in each resulting `gif part` with the `-g` [command line option](#command-line-options), taking into account the input audio length, the available memory of your system, as well as the resulting framerate.

## Boosting lower amplitude bars

If the resulting animation has several bars with consistently low amplitudes, impacting the final visualization in a negative way, you can use the `-lb` [command line argument](#command-line-options) and boost them depending on the values provided. Below is an animation showing the changes to the relative amplitude depending on the values provided for `a` and`b`:
